# Using PDKs

Process Design Kits, or PDKs, are files provided by a foundry that enables chips
to be implemented for a specific foundry process.

LibreLane supports multiple process design kits, so long that an LibreLane PDK
configuration file is made for them.

## Specifying your PDK

There are multiple ways to specify a PDK from the command-line interface,
ordered by priority (from highest to lowest):

* Within the `config.json` file: Recommended only for designs that are compatible
  with exactly one PDK.
* The `--pdk` command-line flag
* The `PDK` environment variable
* The default PDK, i.e., the [Skywater/Google 130nm PDK](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk).

Note that the PDK provided must be a fully qualified PDK variant, i.e.

* `sky130` ❌
* `sky130A` ⭕

## Standard Cell Libraries

Standard cells are small silicon patterns that are used to implement basic
functionality throughout your design that have already been designed and
analyzed for timing and other physical information. For example, the standard
cell `sky130_fd_sc_hd__and1` implements a logical AND.

Each PDK comes bundled with collections of standard cells known as "standard
cell libraries" or SCLs for short, some of which are foundry-provided and some
of which are third-party. Each LibreLane PDK configuration specifies a default
standard cell library, so you don't have to worry about picking one- but if you
want to anyway, ordered by priority (from highest to lowest):

* Within the `config.json` file
* The `--scl` command-line flag
* The `STD_CELL_LIBRARY` environment variable
* The default SCL as dictated by the LibreLane PDK configuration files.
  * For sky130, that's `sky130_fd_sc_hd`.

## Building, location and downloading

Most open-source PDKs are not usable in their default formats. This is the reason
we rely on Open PDKs to build the PDK, which will not only place it an LibreLane-friendly
layout but also generate views of the PDK that are usable by the aforementioned
tools.

Because of extended build times,
the [Skywater/Google 130nm PDK](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk) and
the [GlobalFoundries/Google GF180MCU PDK](https://github.com/google/gf180mcu-pdk),
are built and cached using [Ciel](https://github.com/fossi-foundation/ciel), a version
manager by the LibreLane team built on top of Open PDKs.

There are multiple variants of each PDK (reflecting different metal stack
configurations):

* `sky130`
  * `sky130A`: The default. 5 metal layers and a local interconnect.
  * `sky130B`: Similar to `sky130A`, but also includes a Resistive RAM (ReRAM)
    layer between `metal1` and `metal2`. See [here](https://sky130-fd-pr-reram.readthedocs.io/en/latest/background.html) for more information. This affects timing as, for example,
    `via1` between `metal1` and `metal2` is twice as high.

Both variants are supported by LibreLane.

```{tip}
The variants are identical on the [front end of line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_of_line),
and Efabless shuttles are "split-lot", i.e., two identical wafers come out of
FEOL are then subjected to different [back end of line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_end_of_line)
processes, one for `A` and one for `B`.

Designs targeting a specific variant are packaged only from the appropriate wafer,
with its "twin" on the other wafer, which has timing issues at best and is a dead
chip at worst, is discarded.

All this to say: you can use either variant on any Efabless `sky130` shuttle (but not
within the same design.)
```

* `gf180mcu`
  * `gf180mcuA`: 3 metal layers.
  * `gf180mcuB`: 4 metal layers.
  * `gf180mcuC`: 5 metal layers.
  * `gf180mcuD`: 5 metal layers, with a slightly thicker top metal layer.
    The thinner top metal layer has issues with delamination on the pads
    according to GlobalFoundries.

[GFMPW0](https://platform.efabless.com/shuttles/GFMPW-0) was run on `C`,
but any and all future shuttles by Efabless will require `gf180mcuD` as per
GlobalFoundry's recommendation. `A` and `B` were never used and are not supported
by LibreLane.

LibreLane is tested with a specific revision of Open PDKs. By default, LibreLane
will attempt to download a build done with that revision using Ciel to the **PDK root**.

## The PDK Root

The PDK root is a directory containing all of your open-source PDKs. LibreLane
is configured to use the PDK root at the following options (from highest to
lowest priority)"

* The `--pdk-root` command-line flag
* The `PDK_ROOT` environment variable
* A folder named `.ciel` in your home directory.

The PDK root stores downloaded versions of the PDK as well as the Ciel metadata
information.

Each PDK family, e.g., `sky130` or `gf180mcu`, has one active version at a time.
Versions of the PDKs are exactly equal to the `open_pdks` revision they were
built with.

```{tip}
PDKs range from 700MiB to 1.5GiB, and they add up *fast*.

You can delete all non-active PDKs by invoking `ciel prune` in your terminal.
```

### Using non-Ciel PDKs

If you want to use PDKs without Ciel (built manually), you will need to pass
this flag:

`--manual-pdk`

This will bypassing checking and attempting to download the PDK using Ciel, so
you can add custom PDKs to the PDK root.

The PDKs must provide the following:

* An LibreLane PDK configuration file at the path `{pdk_root}/{pdk}/libs.tech/librelane/config.tcl`.

This Tcl-based (sorry) config file must include values for all non-optional variables in the {ref}`univ_flow_cvars_pdk`.

* An standard cell library configuration file at the path `{pdk_root}/{pdk}/libs.tech/{scl}/librelane/config.tcl`.

This Tcl-based config file must include values for all non-optional variables in the {ref}`univ_flow_cvars_scl`.

The PDK must also include any step-specific PDK variables for the `Classic` flow
to be compatible with the `Classic` flow.

…it may be prudent to just copy these files from `sky130A` and use that as a
starting point, replacing files and values as you go.
